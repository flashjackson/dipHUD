dipHUD
===========================================================================
A stylish and minimalistic HUD for the game TF2 that was designed around the idea the original TF2 artstyle, while incorporating both modern and original elements to create dipHUD.

A while ago I thought that it would be fun to modify an existing HUD that I liked to suit my needs, and maybe even spruce up a couple of the menus with some white bars. Needless to say, I found HUD editing awesome, being such a great way for me to stretch my creative muscles for a game that I loved. A bazillion and a half ctrl-s shortcuts later, and here we are dipHUD.

It's by no means finished, but since lots of people displayed their intrest in my project, I figured it would be nice to release it for those who want it. I will be adding more features and customization options in the future, but for now, this is really all you get. I'm more into getting a solid base made than into getting a different scoreboard for every person on this planet.

I hope you enjoy! Screenshots can be found at this link httpimgur.comazoNTW
