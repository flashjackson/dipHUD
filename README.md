dipHUD - An opening note.
===========================================================================
A stylish and minimalistic HUD for the game TF2 that was designed around the idea the original TF2 artstyle, while incorporating both modern and original elements to create dipHUD.

A while ago I thought that it would be fun to modify an existing HUD that I liked to suit my needs, and maybe even spruce up a couple of the menus with some white bars. Needless to say, I found HUD editing awesome, being such a great way for me to stretch my creative muscles for a game that I loved. A bazillion and a half ctrl-s shortcuts later, and here we are dipHUD.

I'm finally finished! After lots of edits and addition, I have a product that I'm willing to release!

I hope you enjoy! Screenshots can be found at this link http://imgur.com/azoNTW

Damage Circle

Minimal 6s and HL Scoreboards

Smaller Disguise Menus

Smaller WinPanel

Health Cross

... and more to come!

Instructions on how to install these options can be found in the "instructions.txt" inside the dipHUD-master folder. The damage circle instructions are found inside the damage circle folder.
