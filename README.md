dipHUD
======

To install, navigate to your C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom and put the dipHUD folder into the custom folder. If you want to add any modifications to the hud, just check the customization folder. 

If you are customizing the HUD while you are in-game, you can use the command hud_reloadscheme to refresh the HUD files. If that doesn't work, then just restart the game.

I hope you enjoy my little project! If you have any requests, just post them on the [teamfortress.tv](http://teamfortress.tv/forum/thread/12492-diphud-is-now-complete) thread.

Customization!
===========================================================================
So far, I have added a couple of extra features that you can use to customize your experience with dipHUD. As of release 1.0, I have implemented:

Damage Circle

pvHUD Mode

Minimal 6s and HL Scoreboards

Smaller Disguise Menus

Smaller WinPanel

Health Cross

Crosshairs

Custom Colors

Installer...? I have no experience with this, but I feel like people would like it for simplicity's sake.

... and more to come!

Instructions on how to install these options can be found in the "instructions.txt" inside the dipHUD-master folder. The damage circle instructions are found inside the damage circle folder.

If you have any suggestions, shoot me an email at my email: dipHUD@gmail.com or submit a github issue tracker.

I'd really like to thank the following people for helping me either directly or indirectly with my HUD.

Doodle, for making the HUD bible that we've all come to love and know.

Rays, for being a great streamer and helping me with all my annoying problems with my HUD.

All of the people who have tried my hud and given me feedback, suggestions and motivation.

Flame, for creating the HUD which I used as the base for dipHUD, as well as his handy guide.

Sinders, omp, chippy, quartz, A Psycho, flux, and Goat for inspiration and some elements that went into builing my HUD.

And most of all, blindsight. Thanks to him, I finally know that Kansas is a state, and isn't in Tennesee.
