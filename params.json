{"name":"dipHUD","tagline":"","body":"dipHUD - An opening note.\r\n===========================================================================\r\nA stylish and minimalistic HUD for the game TF2 that was designed around the idea the original TF2 artstyle, while incorporating both modern and original elements to create dipHUD.\r\n\r\nA while ago I thought that it would be fun to modify an existing HUD that I liked to suit my needs, and maybe even spruce up a couple of the menus with some white bars. Needless to say, I found HUD editing awesome, being such a great way for me to stretch my creative muscles for a game that I loved. A bazillion and a half ctrl-s shortcuts later, and here we are dipHUD.\r\n\r\nI'm finally finished! After lots of edits and addition, I have a product that I'm willing to release!\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy!
