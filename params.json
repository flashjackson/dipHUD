{"name":"dipHUD","tagline":"A Team Fortress 2 HUD created by diplodicus.","body":"dipHUD\r\n======\r\n\r\nTo install, navigate to your C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\SteamApps\\common\\Team Fortress 2\\tf\\custom and put the dipHUD folder into the custom folder. If you want to add any modifications to the hud, just check the customization folder. \r\n\r\nIf you are customizing the HUD while you are in-game, you can use the command hud_reloadscheme to refresh the HUD files. If that doesn't work, then just restart the game.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy my little project! If you have any requests, just post them on the [teamfortress.tv](http://teamfortress.tv/forum/thread/12492-diphud-is-now-complete) thread, or post a discussion on [the dipHUD Steam Group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/dipHUD)\r\n\r\n--diplodicus\r\n\r\nInfo and Screenshots.\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nI have created two versions of dipHUD so far. The first is the \"classic\" dipHUD, which is more centred and has smaller text. The second version is a \"pvHUD\" version, which has the layout of pvHUD while still staying true to dipHUD.\r\n\r\nClassic dipHUD Screenshots: http://imgur.com/a/zoNTW\r\n\r\nPV Style dipHUD Screenshots: http://imgur.com/a/ItzhR\r\n\r\nAlso, I have made some customization options for dipHUD, so it can suit all players needs.\r\n\r\nCustomization Screenshots: http://imgur.com/a/Vu3RC\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for checking out dipHUD! I hope you enjoy.\r\n--------------------------------------------------","google":"<script type=\"text/javascript\">    var _gaq = _gaq || [];   _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-44402414-1']);   _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);    (function() {     var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;     ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
