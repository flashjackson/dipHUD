Hello! Thanks for checking out dipHUD, my new creation.

For the moment, the only options I have added are the scoreboard and health cross. To install these options, just go into
their respective folders, select all the folders in that option, copy them and paste them into the dipHUD folder found here.

That's it! No other work required. You're welcome to try out the pvHUD style option, but it's very incomplete. None of the item
meters except for the ubercharge are converted to that style. 

To install, just place the dipHUD folder (along with any custom options) into your custom folder found here:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom

if you're on a 64bit computer 

or

C:\Program Files\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom

if you're on a 32 bit computer.

Make sure you don't have any other HUDs installed, or else some elements may be distorted, not visible or just plain messed up. If
you have any bugs or requests, you can submit them on the TFTV thread (http://teamfortress.tv/forum/thread/11891-diphud) or on the
reddit thread (http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/1l8nb2/remember_diphud/)

Enjoy!
