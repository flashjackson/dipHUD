To enable, go to the dipHUD folder, then go to scripts and open up hudlayout.res

The first entry in the file should be xHairCirclePulse. This is the thing that will flash when you do damage. Then find the part
that says:

"visible"		"0"

and change it to

"visible"		"1"

That's all you need to do! I'm not too sure if it will be in the right place if you have a resolution other than 1920x1080, but 
from what I can see, you won't have a problem with it.

Enjoy!
